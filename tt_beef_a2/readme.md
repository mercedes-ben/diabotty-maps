##Installation

1. Download the .rbe file by clicking the "Download" button on the map page

2. Place the map file into your Diabotical maps folder, probably located at `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Diabotical\maps`

3. Load the map in edit mode by typing `/edit tt_beef_a2` into Diabotical's console



##Known issues

* Stage 17 is missing a teleport on the door. At the moment it's not possible to move/disable a teleport as far as I know. This will be updated if I ever find a workaround.

* Map must be loaded in editor mode to play. This will be updated when Diabotical's custom map support is updated, or a workaround is found.

* Rocket launcher is not given to the player when loaded in race mode. This will be updated if a workaround for weapon spawns and ammo refill is found.
